# 3D shape matching with ant colony optimization

3D extension to the paper:

## Compile

Compile this project using the standard cmake routine:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

This should find and build the dependencies and create a `3daco` binary.

## Run

From within the `build` directory just issue:

    ./3daco <model_path1> <model_path2>
